## 1. Information We Collect

When you use Naturalness Check, we collect the following type of information:

* **Text Input:** We collect the text that you actively enter or provide within the App when you choose to use features that involve sending text for correction or improvement.

---

## 2. How and Why We Use Your Information

The primary purpose of collecting your text input is to provide you with the core functionality of the App: to **fix, correct, or improve your entered text using an AI model**.

* **Processing by LLM:** The text you provide is sent to a Language Model (LLM) to analyze and generate corrected or improved versions. This process is essential for the App's functionality.
* **Returning Corrected Text:** The output from the LLM (the corrected or improved text) is then returned to you within the App for your use.

We do not use your text input for advertising, profiling, or any purpose other than providing the requested text correction service.

---

## 3. Data Sharing

To provide the text correction service, we share your entered text with a third-party Language Model (LLM) provider.

* **LLM Provider:** Your text is sent to the LLM of your choice for processing via their API. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of the LLM of your choice to understand their data handling practices.
* We do not share your text input with any other third parties for their marketing or advertising purposes.

---

## 4. Data Retention

* **Our App:** We do **not** store your text input on our servers after it has been processed and the corrected text has been returned to you. The text is processed in real-time and not retained by us beyond the immediate transaction.
* **LLM Provider:** Regarding the LLM provider, data retention policies of the LLM of your choice govern how long they retain the data sent to them. Please refer to their privacy policy for details.

---

## 5. Data Security

We take reasonable measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. When your text is sent to the LLM provider, it is transmitted securely using **encryption (HTTPS)** to protect it during transit.

---

## 6. Your Rights

Depending on your location and applicable laws, you may have the following rights regarding your personal data:

* **Right to Access:** You have the right to request access to the personal data we hold about you.
* **Right to Rectification:** You have the right to request that we correct any inaccurate or incomplete personal data.
* **Right to Erasure (Right to be Forgotten):** You have the right to request that we delete your personal data. As we do not retain your text input after processing, this right is primarily applicable to any other incidental data we might hold about your usage (e.g., app settings).
* **Right to Withdraw Consent:** You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time where we relied on your consent to process your personal information. You can typically disable the text correction feature within the App's settings, which will prevent your text from being sent to the LLM.

To exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the information provided below.

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date at the top. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
